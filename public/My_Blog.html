Can't believe its been 17 days since I last touched a computer! Well actually its been 13 cause I spent the last 4 getting this laptop running and also getting back these original souce files for my projects. All my projects put together have at least 10,000 lines of code and accompishments that would be a waste to lose! Well hope everyone liked my intro video. I am still working on the live comments section to receive all your valuable inputs! Then we can all work on the blog page and my other websites together!" </p>

                <h4>Blog Entry:009</h4>
                <p class="blog-p p1">"Good day my fellow readers..Yes yess I know I missed a blog yesterday yet it was imperative that i took break from programming. I spent the majority of my day researching different ways of implementing the comment section. I have decided
                    to use Google Firebase to be the server I use to store the the comments so they can be retrieved and loaded on the site when ever the comments page is loaded. This was the first half of my evening yesterday, after that I wanted to
                    post a blog about firebase but I decided to go learn the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface">API's</a> associated with firebase's products that I would be using. I did that before I posted my blog
                    just incase the API syntax turned out to be too complicating and a waste of time! Turns out it was pretty simple to use i just have to work on plugging it into my website. Also there is the added option of making the comments anonymous
                    or authenticated so that I would at least have an idea of who was posting due to the persistent tags the comments would carry. There would also be a benefit towards being an authenticated user, which is you would have the option of
                    a display Picture to go along with your activities on my blog site. After my morning training session my main focus for the duration of the day will be to get at least the anonymous comment section live and working so that i can get
                    feed back to questionz i have about the designs of my site!! Hope everyone has a blessed day today. Enjoy. </p>

                <p class="blog-p p1">"Well started off the day with a bang, and when I say bang I meant it literally cause that was the sound of my body hit the mat after going through some judo drills with a few friends of mine..Big up to Tonz and Marcos for the vibes they
                    bring to the morning training session. <br> Anyways...after that shot of adrenaline and testosterone, some idiotic part of me thought it was a good idea to go toil in the sun clearing a piece of land to do some gardening..yayy Testosterone..yayy
                    but noooo...lol feeling like crap right now tho! Right now no amount of water I have drank so far since 1pm has hydrated me. So in the spirit of keeping up with the coding challenge, I figured I would just right a blog and place a
                    link to a comedy I watch recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T0Jv391NvLY">HERE</a> and just like that tadddaaa coding challenge day 3 complete lol ..but srsly yeah that's IT! Have fun viewing! I'll leave same link

                    creative process, there are still guidelines we need to follow if you dont want your computer screaming at you..lol. Some of those strict rules would be to end a completed line of code (statement) with a semi-colon. Today I forgot
                    one of those semi-colons and when you have 100+ lines of code tracking down some types of errors can be those worse thing to do. This process of finding and editing errors is called debugging.. And today I almost bugged tf out looking
                    for this stupid simple error..OOMMGG!! It was just so stupid tho..because of that one missing ; I more or less wasted all day. but as they say little progress is still progress!!. "</p>

                <p class="blog-p p1">"Good day everyone! In this blog i will be addressing some FAQ's. Such as FAQ means Frequently Asked Question. Ok lets get started. <br>(1) This blog website is being created from scratch using programming languages. <br> In my definition
                    and understanding .<br>(2) A programming language is a library of shortcuts used to give a computer binary instrutions to complete, All programming languages are written in english <i>or at least some may seem like english ..lol</i>.
                    <br> (3) The Programming Language used in this site will be vanilla javascript..(just sounds so yummy :P). The web page's look and feel is written in two mark up languages - HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) and CSS (Cascading Style
                    Sheets). If anyone would like to start programming as a hobby or career..I recommend starting with HTML and CSS ! BTW I believe all programming languages are free to learn you just have to be interested in learning and let google whisk
                    you away!
                    <br> (4) The External projects are not available yet because as I mentioned in an earlier FAQ that this blog site is being created from scratch, and I have decided to focus on making the blog site as reader and user friendly as possible
                    before I go off and get lost in the other projects... <br>(5) My developer notes are not there yet. This is because I will be doing most of the update talks in my blog for the 1st few days. "</p>

                    look and feel of the blog pages on different size devices. I know some of you readers are eager to see whats all the <i>hubbub </i> surrounding my other projects but they will come in time! In the mean time I will be working on making
                    your 100 day read on my page is as interactive and exciting as i can! " </p>
