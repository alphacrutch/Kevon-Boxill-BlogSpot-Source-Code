            <div class="title">Welcome To K.B Blog SPot</div>
            <p class="p1">Welcome to my blog spot. MY name is Kevon Boxill. This blog spot was created mainly for the purpose of posting my progress while doing a <i> 100 day coding challenge</i>. The projects I will be working on will be my personal web projects as
                well as this blog. Links to the projects will be provided as I go through the
                <i>coding challenge</i>. </p>
            <p class="p1">This blog will be updated daily. Feel Free to check on my progess and read the dev notes on upcoming features that will be added to my blog post.
            </p>

    <div id="modal" class="modal">
        <div class="modal-header">
            <div class="title">Dev Notes and Feature updates</div>
            <button data-close-button class="close-button"> &times;</button>

            <ul>
                <li>
                    Comments page in progress not saving data to be shown on refresh yet.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The Recipe table project is live atm for viewing. I am still working on an Authentication feature for the the Recipe Table Project. As it stands viewers are able to create a custom account with an email and password or sign up with their Gmail Accounts.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The All Fours Project will take a while to be published as game projects have alot of moving parts that need to be properly synced to run efficiently. Also the All Fours project was designed for a Big Screen like a PC or Laptop. So even if it were to
                    be launched it will be ugly to look at on smaller devices.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Still working on a realtime comment board for you viewers to post your opinions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Still to come is an authentication system for this site to personalise viewer comments. Also this will serve to denied or allow viewer access to certain features on the site such all commenting and realTime messaging
                </li>
                <li>
                    I also would like to expand this site to a public Blog sit where anyone can create a blog and post it to a blog forum or just a personal blog profile. What you guys think?
                </li>
