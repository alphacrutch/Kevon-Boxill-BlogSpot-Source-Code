                My name is <i>Kevon Boxill </i> and I am a <i>self-taught</i> Software Developer. I started this journey about over a year ago. I have always been an avid follower of the computer arts but would always be to afraid to dive into computer
                programming.
                <br> I had the notion that it would be filled with 1's and 0's, but to my surprise it was totally easy. I am always looking for new knowledge and ways to expand my knowledge.
            </blockquote>
            <blockquote class="p1">
                Althought I am and will always still be on my journey to becoming an internationally recognised Software Developer, looking back on my progress, I feel proud to call myself a software developer. I am presently persueing and developing my web development
                skills, to better bolster my portfolio as i throw myself into the web-dev forest.

                    The Recipe table project is live atm for viewing. I am still working on an Authentication feature for the the Recipe Table Project. As it stands viewers are able to create a custom account with an email and password or sign up with their Gmail Accounts.

                    The All Fours Project will take a while to be published as game projects have alot of moving parts that need to be properly synced to run efficiently. Also the All Fours project was designed for a Big Screen like a PC or Laptop. So even if it were to
                    be launched it will be ugly to look at on smaller devices.

                    Still working on a realtime comment board for you viewers to post your opinions.

                    Still to come is an authentication system for this site to personalise viewer comments. Also this will serve to denied or allow viewer access to certain features on the site such all commenting and realTime messaging
                </li>
                <li>
                    I also would like to expand this site to a public Blog sit where anyone can create a blog and post it to a blog forum or just a personal blog profile. What you guys think?
